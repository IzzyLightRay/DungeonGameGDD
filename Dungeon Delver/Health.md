A blood system where your 'vitality' is the amount of blood in your system, so besides the destruction of the head or chest (death, the instant kind), most injuries will either give blood loss (health damage) or debuffs (broken limbs). 

Poison would deal damage over time proportional to the "current health" with a pretty low minimum so there are no ticks where no damage is actually delt. That and/or poisons could accrue "hard damage" or permanent damage until cured or healed by magic.
