The Dungeon is a perilous place with monsters, traps, and tricky terrain. Players will have to balance their equipment load with gear and weapons to fend off monsters and the darkness, and have supplies to survive and traverse the depths. 

## Floor layouts 
Each floor has a theme, in which the majority of the floor is designed around. Example, the first floor is a catacombs, but there can easily be caves that are more cavernous, or maybe a segment of burrows or a cellar or two that might act as alternate entrances. An idea for a later floor would be a flooded castle town, different segments could include the inside of larger buildings that are dry, or even the difference  between the surface of the water and the ramparts and tops of buildings vs. the flooded lower levels that would require equipment to go down or a mage with magic to help survive underwater. 

## Floors
- Floor 1 
	-  The first floor is the catacombs of the ruins that the village was built upon. The catacombs are dark and dingy, with tight tunnels and winding corridors. A segment could also include some flooded corridors or even half flooded rooms. Broken stairways collapsed room, or caved in floors could be ways to force alternate routes or allow players who pack items to be able to get use out of them.  
	- The first floor would also have caves intersecting in and out that would be both more twisty in their paths, but also have spots with open crevasses and caverns. The caves would involve needing more pitons and rope because they might get more vertical.
