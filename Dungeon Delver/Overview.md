# Design Document

## Design Guidelines

A more gritty in tone fantasy setting where there is magic, dragons, and heroes of legend, there are no historical heroes here. Most if not all armor and weapons are simple, magic is low level, and most people who delve into the depths are commoners or vagrants. Lower levels of the dungeon might have more high fantasy monsters, but the most of the dungeon is centered around lower levels of your typical RPG. 

## Game Design Definitions

Winning is more about exploring a new section of the dungeon, killing a big monster, leveling up, or getting a piece of loot. Losing would be getting killed, as that would be the end of your character, their loot and skills would be lost and they would leave behind their legacy. The Dungeon is the biggest part of the game, short of the town where some NPC's or even players are set up for trade and barter of gear, components, or information, the levels are connected by large stairwells that indicate the progress of one floor to another. The main focus of the gameplay is the exploration and exploitation of the dungeon.

## Player Definition

The player would be a character that they can create, from skills, race, class, and disposition. The backstory would be more so a series of broad options that you can fit your own ideas into, Races would include things like Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Halflings, and other typical fantasy races. Classes would each add a layer of gameplay on top of the base game, the fighter would have a large selection of weapons and fighting styles, the Rogue would be focusing of exploration and disarming traps, and the spellcasters would have their variety of magic available to them depending on what discipline they pick as a sub-class.
