The gear would consist of [[Weapons]], armor, exploration tools, and artifacts. 

## Weapons
- [[Weapons]] have a unique page, but most weapons will be non-magic or at the most limited magic. 

## Armor
- Armor might get a unique page, depending on how crowded this gets. Armor is going to have a big impact on the [[endurance]] system, as well as the [[Movement]] systems. 
	- Cloth would predominantly be used as covering for classes that would be impeded in things like spellcasting as it would have minimal to no movement issues but would provide minimal slashing and piercing damage. 
	- Leather would be the middle ground as it would not be as heavy or encumbering as metallic armors, but still provide ample protection against blades, claws, and teeth. (slashing and piercing damage). Blunt damage would still go through with a bit of reduction, mainly nullifying minor clips or non-clean hits. 
	- Metallic armors would include chainmail and plate armors, these would vary in weights but still be heavy. These armors would all but nullify piercing and slashing, bludgeoning would still do damage, just not as much(thinking between 30~60%). The caveat of heavy armor would be that your [[endurance]] would run out very quickly, meaning your party would have to stop for camp more often, using more resources and being harder to reach deeper layers. 
 
## Exploration tools
- The exploration tools would allow the players to make certain passable, light the darkness, mark your path, or negate environmental effects. 
	- Pitons - Metal spikes that can be hammered into walls to make climbing easier/possible, or to secure ropes to access lower areas. 
	- Rope - Can be used to lower players and items, to help players up ledges, or secured to create vertical paths. 
	- Torches - Used to light the darkness, might be redundant with a mage that knows a light spell. 
	- Chalk - Can be used to mark pathways, a way back, or symbols letting other adventurers know of dangers ahead. 
	- Backpacks - Used to carry items, but can be dropped to fight better when movement is needed. 
	- Bedroll - Makes resting at camp restore more endurance 
	- Crowbar - Used to pry open crates, chests, or doors
	- Flask - Can hold liquid 
	- Grappling Hook - used more so as a way to traverse vertically, create temporary dropdowns, or even swing across medium sized gaps
	- Lantern - A longer lasting torch, but is breakable and requires oil
	- Net - Used to snare monsters or to catch creatures 
	- Oil - Used in the lantern but also can be used as an environmental trap
	- Parchment - Can be drawn on with a pencil, used for making maps and notes, but can be drawn on in any regard
	- Charcoal pencil - A slim piece of charcoal that is grabbed and wrapped with a small amount of hide, or not, Mr. dirty hands
	- Shovel - Used to dig up buried items, to clear paths, or to bury said items.
	- Signal Whistle - Used to blow a signal across many rooms. 
	- Tents - Used as shelter while setting up camp
	- Waterskin - Used to hold water for drinking while taking up camp, or to give temp. endurance. 

## Artifacts 
- Artifacts are potential system, they would function like the artifacts from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but without the radiation damage. You would only have a few slots for artifacts and they might give just as many downsides as upsides. Some possible examples of effects could be...
	- +- Carry weight
	- +- Stamina 
	- +- Mana 
	- +-
